# Traffic-Light-Automation


I made a traffic light automation program with the use arduino to detect the vehicles count and let the allow to pass on their number.

#Function

1. The program detects the count of vehicles on the road and gives a green light for the place with more vehicles.
2. It automates the lights with time limits every time a new vehicle adds to the junction, the amount of vehicles increases the time limits to pass through the juction for each side.
3. An emergency vehicle to pass, can associate with the head server to pass through a road directly without wating so long.
