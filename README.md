# Traffic-Light-Automation


I made a traffic light automation program with an arduino to detect the vehicles count and let them to pass on the basis of their count and emergency.

# Function

* The program detects the count of vehicles on the road and gives a green light for the place with more vehicles.
* It automates the lights with time limits every time a new vehicle adds to the junction, the amount of vehicles increases the time limits increases to pass through the juction for each side.
* An emergency vehicle to pass, can associate with the head server to pass through a road directly without wating so long.
